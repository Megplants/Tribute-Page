   <div class="intro"> <p><i>Mary Anning was a fossil hunter and early paleontologist. Because she was a woman, her discoveries were largely claimed by the male scientists of her time. <p>Read on for a few facts about her life and discoveries.</p></i></p></div>
   
    <div class="early"><h3>Early Years</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Birth</b>
      <p> Born in 1799 in Lyme Regis, which is located in a part of southwest England that is now known as the "Jurassic Coast". This area is rich with fossils and discoveries are still being made there today.</p></li>
      <li><b>Collecting Fossils</b>
      <p> Mary learned to collect and clean fossils from her father. He was a cabinetmaker and would  sell them in his shop to fashonable vacationers visiting the coast.</p></li>
      <li><b>Father's Death</b>
      <p> Mary's father died of tuberculosis when she was 11 years old, leaving behind Mary, her mother, and Mary's older brother Joseph.</p></li>
      <li><b>Supporting Her Family</b>
      <p>After her father's death, Mary continued selling fossils to help support her family.</p></li>
      </ul></div>
      
      <div class="discoveries"><h3>Discoveries</h3><ul>
        <li><b>Ichthyosaurus</b>
        <p> When Mary was 12 years old, her brother, Joseph, found a strange fossilized skull. Mary unearthed the remainder of the skeleton. Scientists of the time thought it was a crocodile since it was believed that strange looking fossils were simply creatures that had wandered from far-off lands. After being studied and debated for years, it was named Ichthyosaurus, meaning 'fish lizard'.</p></li>
        <li><b>Plesiosaurus</b>
        <p> In 1823 Mary unearthed the first complete Plesiosaur fossil; a partial fossil had been discovered about a hundred years prior. Mary's fossil was so strange that rumours spread that it was fake. A special meeting was held by the Geological Society of London to debate its authenticity. Being a woman, Mary was not invited to participate.</p></li>
        <li><b>Dimorphodon</b>
        <p> In 1828 Mary uncovered a pile of fossilized bones that had a long tail and wings. William Buckland presented her finding to the Geological Society of London, naming it Pterodactylus macronyx.</p></li>
        </ul></div>
        <div class="later"><h3>Later Years</h3>
        <ul><li><b>Financial Struggles</b>
        <p>Despite her amazing discoveries that helped advance scientic understandings, Mary struggled financially her entire life. Even after she got cancer she continued to sell fossils, working through the physical pain of the disease.</p></li>
        <li><b>Death</b>
        <p>Mary died in 1847 from breast cancer. She was 47 years old.</p></li>
        </ul></div>
        
        <div><h3>Women in Science</h3>
        <p>Women of Mary's time were not given formal education, though Mary was taught to read and write. Her discoveries were bought from her by male scientists which they presented as their own findings, leaving Mary without credit. The Geological Society of London, where her discoveries were presented, refused to admit her. Though she did not recieve official credit for her discoveries, her reputation was well known and stories of her were told long after her death.</p></div></div>
